# Data Management Issues

## Critical Issues
- **Data Loss Risk**: Using localStorage means data is browser-specific and can be cleared easily
- **No Data Backup**: No mechanism to backup or restore data if localStorage is cleared
- **Data Synchronization**: Multiple tabs/devices will have independent data stores
- **No Data Export**: Although mentioned in README, there's no actual implementation for exporting data
- **Storage Limits**: localStorage is limited to 5MB, which can be reached with many employees/tasks

## Recommended Fixes
- Implement proper backend database storage
- Add data export/import functionality
- Consider implementing IndexedDB for larger storage needs
- Add data synchronization between devices
