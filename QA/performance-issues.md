# Performance Issues

## Critical Issues
- **Rendering Optimization**: Excessive re-renders in components like EmployeeGrid
- **Memory Leaks**: Potential memory leaks from uncleared timeouts/subscriptions
- **Large Datasets**: Poor performance when handling large employee datasets
- **Image Optimization**: Avatar images not optimized for fast loading
- **Bundle Size**: No code splitting implemented for better loading times

## Recommended Fixes
- Implement React.memo and useMemo for expensive components
- Add proper cleanup for effects and subscriptions
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Optimize images and implement lazy loading
- Add code splitting for better initial load times
