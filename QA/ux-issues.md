# User Experience Issues

## Critical Issues
- **Loading States**: Missing loading indicators when data is being fetched
- **Error Handling**: Error messages are technical rather than user-friendly
- **Form Validation**: Incomplete form validation with inconsistent error messages
- **Mobile Optimization**: Some components don't render well on smaller screens
- **Accessibility Issues**: Missing proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: No confirmation when performing destructive actions

## Recommended Fixes
- Add proper loading states for all data operations
- Implement comprehensive form validation with clear error messages
- Enhance mobile responsiveness
- Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions (delete, etc.)
- Improve accessibility compliance
